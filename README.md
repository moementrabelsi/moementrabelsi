# 👋 Hey there, I’m Abdelmoemen Trabelsi

🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Developer by day, code whisperer by night.  
🎓 Officially an engineer, unofficially a debugger of mysteries and slayer of semicolons.

🚀 Building cool things with the **MERN stack**—MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (aka, my four horsemen of productivity).  
🤖 Dabbled in some AI wizardry too—built a face recognition module with **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV**. My laptop may or may not fear me now.

## 🛠️ Skills include (but are not limited to):

- Speaking fluent `console.log`
- Arguing with `async/await`
- Writing code that sometimes works on the first try (I call it "accidental brilliance")

---

## 📦 Favorite tools:
`React.js` • `Vue.js` • `Redux` • `Axios` • `SpringBoot` • `MongoDB`  
...and a healthy dose of **Stack Overflow**.

## 🌍 Based in:
- Tunisia (born & based) 🇹🇳  
- France (trained) 🇫🇷  
- Slovenia (debugged) 🇸🇮  

---

## 🎮 When not coding, I'm probably:
- Playing strategy games pretending to be productive 🧠🎮  
- Watching movies like I’m reviewing them for Rotten Tomatoes 🎬  
- Camping in real life because my code won’t run away from me there ⛺
