# 👋 Hey there, I’m Abdelmoemen Trabelsi

🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Developer by day, code whisperer by night.  
🎓 Officially an engineer, unofficially a debugger of mysteries and slayer of semicolons.

🚀 Currently building full-stack magic at [**SupaSoft**](https://supasoft.com.tn/), where I turn coffee into code and complex ideas into clean, scalable apps.  
🧠 I enjoy translating real-world problems into smart technical solutions—and sometimes even elegant ones.

🤖 Recently got hands-on with AI: I crafted a face recognition module using **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV**. It works great... unless the face is mine before coffee.

## 🛠️ Skills include (but are not limited to):

- Speaking fluent `console.log` (also `print`, `echo`, and `why isn't this working?!`)
- Arguing with `async/await` like it owes me money
- Writing code that compiles first try (or at least pretending it did)
- Debugging until the bug begs for mercy

---

## 📦 Favorite tools and frameworks:

Here’s what’s usually in my utility belt:

- 🎨 **Frontend:** `React.js`, `Vue.js`, `Angular`  
- 🔧 **Backend:** `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `SpringBoot`  
- 📡 **API & State:** `Redux`, `Axios`, `Context API`  
- 🗃️ **Databases:** `MongoDB`, `MySQL`, `NoSQL`  
- 🧠 **AI/ML:** `TensorFlow`, `OpenCV`  
- 🧰 And, of course, a healthy dependence on **Stack Overflow**

## 🌍 Based in:
- 🇹🇳 **Tunisia** (home sweet home)  
- 🇫🇷 **France** (learned a lot, ate well)  
- 🇸🇮 **Slovenia** (coded hard, debugged harder)

---

## 🎮 When not coding, you’ll catch me:

- Strategizing my next digital conquest in multiplayer games 🎮  
- Watching movies like I'm secretly preparing a film podcast 🎬  
- Camping far from Wi-Fi because nature never throws runtime errors ⛺
